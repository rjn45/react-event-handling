📌 React Event Handling & Counter App

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of handling events and managing state in React using functional components. It includes two main components: BasicEvents and Counter, along with a reusable button component called CounterButton.

🚀 Features

✔ Handle multiple event types such as click, hover, and input change
✔ Use useState to update and display dynamic values
✔ Counter with multiple actions:

Increment / Decrement

Reset to 0

Set Count to 100

Double current value

Change by custom values (+/-1, +5, +10, etc.)

✔ Reusable button UI using props
✔ Conditional styling (count turns red if it's negative)
